### Discord auto-bumper

After getting the project for the first time, execute these commands **in your project directory**:

1. Run `pip3 install pipreqs`.
2. Run `pip3 install pyinstaller`.
3. Run `pyinstaller main.py --onefile`.

Then, you can run it yourself whenever by executing these commands **in your project directory**:

1. Run `./dist/main` (this will run the executable).
2. Then, following the promps on the terminal window, press any key + enter.
3. Quickly move your cursor to your Discord server textfield.
4. Sit tight! Your server will now be automatically bumped until you cancel the program.

To cancel the program after running it:

1. Put your cursor into the terminal window, and press CTRL+C or CMD+C.
